WIP 3D Rendering engine running off of rust Rocket.
Don't ask why I didn't use NodeJS, I setup rust and then just felt like doing all the compuation on the web end anyways so it doesn't really matter.
May experiment with some account cookies stuff with rocket once im done with the simple engine.
This wont be worked on too much but feel free to comment any suggestions.
